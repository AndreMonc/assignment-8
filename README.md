# Assignment 8

We talked about iteration and using `while` and `for` to accomplish iteration.  Here, I want you to build off the new knowledge you have of `while` and `for` while revisiting a couple of tasks that you've already seen.  As with the previous assignment, fork and clone this repository. Then create a directory equivalent to your username in the `answers` directory.  Within your `answers/username` directory, write a program to complete each task, below. Name each of the programs you are writing, according to the "task" (e.g. task1.py). Commit those programs, push them up to your cloned repository, and make a pull request.

## Task 1

Previously, you wrote a program that used a recursive function to compute the sum of the integers from 0 to 1000 (inclusive).  This time, I want you to accomplish the same thing, but using a `while` loop. Compute the sum of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) in a function using `while`. Return the sum of these numbers to the main loop and print the result. Write the program to include a `main()` function and the `ifmain` statement.

## Task 2

Above, you wrote a program that used a `while` loop to compute the sum of the integers from 0 to 1000 (inclusive).  This time, I want you to accomplish the same thing, but using a `for` loop. Compute the sum of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) in a function using `for`. Return the sum of these numbers to the main loop and print the result. Write the program to include a `main()` function and the `ifmain` statement.

## Task 3

In Python, we tend to use `for` loops over different types of iterators much more than `while` loops - they're more flexible and iterators are **everywhere** in Python.  Write a program that includes 5 different functions, each of which should demonstrate the use of `for` over **different types** of iterators. Your program should include these five functions, a `main()` function that calls all the other functions, and the `ifmain` statement.
