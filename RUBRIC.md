## Task 1

Previously, you wrote a program that used a recursive function to compute the sum of the integers from 0 to 1000 (inclusive).  This time, I want you to accomplish the same thing, but using a `while` loop. Compute the sum of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) in a function using `while`. Return the sum of these numbers to the main loop and print the result. Write the program to include a `main()` function and the `ifmain` statement.

- [ ] Program is correctly formatted with shebang, description, code (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program includes `main()` function and "ifmain" statement (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program computes sum using a `while` loop in it's own function (1 pt)
- [ ] Program correctly computes and displays sum of 0 to 1000, inclusive (1 pt)

## Task 2

Above, you wrote a program that used a `while` loop to compute the sum of the integers from 0 to 1000 (inclusive).  This time, I want you to accomplish the same thing, but using a `for` loop. Compute the sum of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) in a function using `for`. Return the sum of these numbers to the main loop and print the result. Write the program to include a `main()` function and the `ifmain` statement.

- [ ] Program is correctly formatted with shebang, description, code (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program includes `main()` function and "ifmain" statement (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program computes sum using a `for` loop in it's own function (1 pt)
- [ ] Program correctly computes and displays sum of 0 to 1000, inclusive (1 pt)

## Task 3

In Python, we tend to use `for` loops over different types of iterators much more than `while` loops - they're more flexible and iterators are **everywhere** in Python.  Write a program that includes 5 different functions, each of which should demonstrate the use of `for` over **different types** of iterators. Your program should include these five functions, a `main()` function that calls all the other functions, and the `ifmain` statement.

- [ ] Program is correctly formatted with shebang, description, code (1 pt)
- [ ] Program includes `main()` function and "ifmain" statement (1 pt)
- [ ] Program contains 5, correct subfunctions that use `for` over **different types** of iterators (5 pt)
- [ ] Program's `main()` function calls all subfunctions (1 pt)
- [ ] Program runs and correctly demonstrates use of `for` (1 pt)
